Today a big change happened. The content hosting for this blog moved to GitHub pages.
<!--End of Excerpt--> 

**You may wonder WHY?**

Very simple. Flexibility and mobility. 
Now I can add and manage the content from anywhere using [prose.io](https://prose.io){:target="_blank"} or any machine that supports [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git){:target="_blank"}.
