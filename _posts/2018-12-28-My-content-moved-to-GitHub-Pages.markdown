Today a big change happened. The content hosting for this blog moved to GitHub pages.
<!--End of Excerpt--> 

**You may wonder WHY?**

Very simple. Flexibility and mobility. 
I like to write in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){:target="_blank"}. Moreover I now can add and change content from anywhere using for example [prose.io](https://prose.io){:target="_blank"} or any other text editor and then using [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git){:target="_blank"} to push the changes back to [GitHub](https://github.com){:target="_blank"}.
