This digital playground is built on a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org){:target="_blank"} powered by [Github](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Netlify](https://netlify.com/){:target="_blank"} and [JEKYLL](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}. 

There are many ways to build a website. I wanted to have a lightweight approach, which is secure, performing well and if possible at no cost. This is were the idea of using the JAMstack arised. The basic idea of the JAMstack is to separate development from hosting. In terms of development I decided to go with Jekyll, a static site generator. Jekyll is setup quickly, is blog-aware out of the box and it works well with Github. For the hosting a [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network){:target="_blank"} is a great choice and therefore I went with Netlify, which comes witha free plan and offers a [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD){:target="_blank"} integration with Github. Once setup correctly the workflow is seamless. 

If you want to have a simple setup, at no cost, with a high degree of security and performance then you may want to consider a similar setup and embrace the benefits of the JAMstack. No computer science degree required.
