<!--End of Excerpt--> 

This allows me to run an end to end CI/CD workflow in the cloud. 

Before. I had my markup files on my local machine, writing the code, compiling it, opening the ftp client, pushing my latest file versions to my webserver. 

Today. I have my code editor (VS Code). I check-out my code from Github. I write my code (content). I check it back in. This automatically triggers my CI/CD pipeline, deploying the change to the webserver (Netlify). 
I can focus more on my content and invest less time into the process of moving code around. I wish this would work so easily in my corporate world. Corporations do like process monkeys though.
