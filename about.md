#### Dad. Partner. Entrepreneur.

# Hi. I am Christian

I run this blog with the intent to share my views - and only my views, thoughts and whatever else I may think is worth sharing on the wonderful internet. 

For my living I work with people, for people. 
You can find my resume on [Linkedin](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/christianpopa){:target="_blank"}.

Outside the corporate world I am..

.. a proud dad and partner.

.. an entrepreneur, [making people happy with hand crafted gelato](https://eiszeit.co/){:target="_blank"}. 

.. an avid learner, hungry to learn something new every day.

.. passioned about photography and design. You can find some of my attempts to paint with light [here](https://500px.com/p/christianpopa?view=photos){:target="_blank"}.

I live nearby Zurich, Switzerland.
