#### Proud father, internet and technology geek and a passionate photographer.

# Hi. I am Christian

This is my digital playground. Still working on the content though.

I am holding a degree in Information Technology. For my living I manage customer experience and digital delivery topics in the Human Resources area for a Swiss Re:insurance company. You can find my resume on [Linkedin](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/christianpopa){:target="_blank"}.

I live nearby Zurich, Switzerland. Since the birth of my children I became
very interested in photography. You can find some of my attempts to paint with light on  [500px](https://500px.com/christianpopa){:target="_blank"}.

This blog is hand made with HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. The content is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, with the code managed on [GitHub](https://github.com/){:target="_blank"}, deployed and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com/){:target="_blank"}.
