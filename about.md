# Hi. I am Christian

This is my digital playground. Still working on the content though.

I am holding a degree in Information Technology. For my living I manage digital delivery projects
for a Swiss Re:insurance company. You can read my resume on [Linkedin](https://ch.linkedin.com/in/christianpopa){:target="_blank"} if you are interested to learn more about my professional track record.

I live together with my family nearby Zurich, Switzerland. Since the birth of my children I became
very interested in photography. You can find some of my attempts to paint with light on  [500px](https://500px.com/christianpopa){:target="_blank"}.
